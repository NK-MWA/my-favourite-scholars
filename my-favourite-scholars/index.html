                Abu Musa reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him,

                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Verily, the parable of the guidance and knowledge that Allah 
                Almighty sent with me is the likeness of rain falling upon the earth. 
                Among them is a good group which receives the water and thus there 
                is abundant growth of herbage and grass. Among them is a barren 
                land which retains the water and thus Allah benefits people from it; 
                they drink from it and graze their animals. And it falls upon another 
                group which is only abysmal; it does not retain water, nor does 
                herbage grow. Such is the parable of one who understands the 
                religion of Allah and benefits from what Allah sent with me; he learns 
                and he teaches. Such is the parable of one who does not raise his 
                head and does not accept the guidance Allah sent with me.

                    In another narration, the Prophet said:
                    <br>
                    O people, knowledge only comes by learning and understanding only 
                    comes by seeking understanding. For whomever Allah intends good, 
                    he gives him understanding of the religion. Verily, only those with 
                    knowledge fear Allah among his servants. (35:28)

                    Israr Ahmad[a] (26 April 1932 – 14 April 2010) was a Pakistani Islamic scholar, orator and theologian. He developed a following in Pakistan and the rest of
                    South Asia but also among some South Asian Muslims in the Middle East, Western Europe, and North America.
                    He has written around 60 books on Islam and Pakistan, of which twenty nine have been translated into several other languages, including in English, as of 2017.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1956 he left the Jamaat-e-Islami, which had become involved in electoral politics, to found Tanzeem-e-Islami. Like many other Sunni Islamic
                    activists/revivalists he preached that the teachings of the Qur'an and the Sunnah and divine law of Sharia must be implemented in all spheres of life,
                    that the Caliphate must be restored as a true Islamic state, and that Western values and influences were a threat to Islam and Pakistan. He was also 
                    known for his belief that Pakistan, not Arab lands, should be the foundation for a new caliphate, that democratic governance was un-islamic.
                    He was awarded the Sitara-i-Imtiaz, the third-highest civilian award of Pakistan, in 1981.

                        Zakir Abdul Karim Naik (born 18 October 1965) is an Indian Islamic public orator who focuses on comparative religion.
                         Naik is currently a wanted fugitive in India, where, in 2016, the authorities charged Naik for money laundering while
                          he was abroad in Malaysia; Naik did not return to India and became a permanent resident of Malaysia. Naik denies all
                           charges. The National Investigation Agency attempted to issue an Interpol red notice for his arrest, which was refused
                            due to insufficient evidence.
                            <br>
                        He is the founder and president of the Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) and Peace TV. He is a well-known figure in the 
                        Islamic world, and while he does not claim to be a follower of any one school of thought in Islam, he is most closely 
                        associated with the Salafi school of thought.[15] Naik's Peace TV is banned in India, Bangladesh, Canada, Sri Lanka,
                         and the United Kingdom under hate speech laws.
